			Wastewater Heat Pump (WWHP) technology is a critical innovation in the clean energy sector, representing a renewable energy source with significant potential for thermal energy recovery from urban wastewater. This technology offers crucial advantages over conventional heating methods. WWHP systems exhibit high energy efficiency, with a Coefficient of Performance (COP) ranging from 4.0 to 4.6, which is 4.2 to 4.8 times higher than the thermal efficiency of electric boilers (0.95). Utilizing this low-temperature thermal energy reduces fossil energy consumption, achieving energy conservation and substantial carbon reduction. Historically, WWHP adoption has been limited by operational challenges such as fouling, corrosion, and high initial investment costs. However, recent innovations have focused on overcoming these bottlenecks, including the development of automatic screening and filtration devices, modular indirect heat exchangers, and the use of corrosion-resistant nonmetallic materials. Advanced physical field modulation techniques, such as ultrasonic descaling and variable-frequency electromagnetic fields, show promise in preventing fouling. Economically, although WWHP systems have higher initial capital costs (ICC) compared to gas or electric boilers, a Life-Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA) confirms their superiority. Over a 15-year service life, the WWHP system is ranked as having the lowest total projected operational costs among conventional heating systems, demonstrating an overall operational cost of only 30.7% of that of oil-fired boilers. These factors validate WWHP technology's sustainable value for large-scale heating applications and climate change mitigation.

			This application is a full-stack Single Page Application (SPA) built with Angular for the frontend and Node.js (Express) for the backend. The backend uses MySQL for persistent data storage and JWT for secure authentication. The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP, displaying dynamic charts using Chart.js based on data retrieved from protected API endpoints. The app is designed for accessibility (ADA/WCAG), and is deployed with NGINX serving the frontend on port 80 and the backend API on port 3000. All sensitive credentials are managed via environment variables and not committed to source control.
