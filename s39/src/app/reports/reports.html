      This chart visualizes the environmental benefits achieved by implementing WWHP technology, focusing on the reduction in atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions achieved over one year by displacing standard coal consumption. The mass reduction data is sourced from statistical analysis of pollutant discharge. The visualization confirms that WWHP systems substantially mitigate environmental degradation. The reduction in CO2 (112,000 kg) constitutes the vast majority of the total mass of emissions reduced, affirming the technology’s pivotal role in climate change mitigation. Additionally, significant quantities of Dust (29,200 kg), SO2 (364 kg), and NOx (317 kg) are avoided annually. This environmental advantage highlights the sustainable value of WWHP in resource recycling and ecological conservation. The core data for this chart is derived from research on the environmental benefits of energy substitution via WWHP.
