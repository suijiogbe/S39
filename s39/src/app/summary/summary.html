    <p>
      This chart compares the total projected operational costs for various heating systems over a 15-year service life, combining the initial capital cost and the subsequent operating costs, based on data derived from life-cycle assessment studies. From a life-cycle comprehensive benefits perspective, the Wastewater Heat Pump (WWHP) system ranks lowest in total cost, demonstrating strong economic performance. The comparison reveals that the total costs follow the order: WWHP < coal-fired boilers < electric boilers < gas boilers < oil-fired boilers (note: electric boiler costs assume low off-peak electricity prices). Specifically, the overall operational cost of the WWHP system demonstrated a significant saving, amounting to only 30.7% of that of oil-fired boilers, thereby validating its economic competitiveness over conventional fossil fuel-based heating systems. The data source for this chart is referenced from published research on the economic viability of WWHP systems.
